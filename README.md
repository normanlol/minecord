A Minecraft/Discord bot dedicated to chatting between the two for easy communication between the two.

This was built with easy configuration in mind. All you need is a Discord bot, a Minecraft account and a bit of patience.

## installation

1. Download the latest release ZIP file.
2. Install NodeJS if you haven't, and the dependencies via ``npm i``.
3. Copy the file ``config.example.json`` and name it ``config.json``.
4. Fill in the file with the needed fields.
5. Run ``node index`` and you're done.

## problems
- Certian servers may not work with this, espescially those that have anti-bot measures.
- If you do not have a spare Minecraft account to use, you can get a cheap one @ [alts.top](https://alts.top) or you can get an official account @ [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net). *The account you use must be a Java account*.
